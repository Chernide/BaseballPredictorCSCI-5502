# Determining What Factors Influence Baseball Players' Performance
#### Team Members: Denver Chernin, Lincoln Schafer, Brandon Kissam
#### Class: CSCI 5502 - Data Mining

This repository contains the statistical analyzation of baseball statistics to determine what factors affect a players MLB Performance. Our team has decided to focus on three main factors for investigation: salary, elevation, and whether or not that player went to college. We use multiple prediction models to determine if classification of statistics is possible for our factors. We used support vector machines and neural networks as well as looking at correlations and standard data set statistics. 

The code for our project has mostly been written in python. This project was completed as part of our Data Mining course at the University of Colorado Boulder where all team members are current graduate students. The repository is divided into sections containing the code for each factor that we investigated. 

We determined that salary and college do not have the statistical influence to predict whether or not performance will increase or decrease, but have seen that elevation is a true factor of MLB performance.

The power of data mining was shown to us through this project. There are many powerful tools that data mining provides that allowed us to deeply look into our data to find the trends we were looking for. We thank our professor and our TAs for supporting us and guiding us to better results.
